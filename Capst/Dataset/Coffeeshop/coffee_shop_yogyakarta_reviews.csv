Tugu Jogja;Nyore Coffee & Space;4.7;1631;Jl. Margo Utomo No.79, Gowongan, Kec. Jetis, Kota Yogyakarta, Daerah Istimewa Yogyakarta 55233, Indonesia;4.0;One of the coffee shops located in Malioboro street. This place has a variety of drinks, snacks, and dishes to try. We tried one of their mocktails, it tastes okay and has a reasonable price. We also tried some of their snacks, such as the Tahu Cabe Garam, which has nice flavours. The place has indoors and semi-outdoors, with smoking and non-smoking areas, and has nice ambience. The staff here are friendly, and the foods and drinks came out relatively quickly. Overall, a good option to visit in Malioboro.;{'name': 'Sadewa 48', 'link': 'https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115855204189200453717?hl=en-US', 'contributor_id': '115855204189200453717', 'thumbnail': 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWm0gBGSsrq_hG0KNqIVR5unyijvpr6w16Ub6OcyI-wCP0Q2EKH=s120-c-rp-mo-ba6-br100', 'local_guide': True, 'reviews': 656, 'photos': 2540};;2 weeks ago

They have several “modern” coffee options (coffee mixed with various things), along with teas and some food.
I ordered Kalamansi Iced Tea and Vietnamese Drip, but they didn’t quite meet my expectations. They served the Vietnamese coffee without the drip tools, and they forgot to give me a spoon to stir it—maybe they rarely serve that one. The cashier didn’t seem to know much about coffee, but fortunately, the waiter was friendly.
There are toilets and a musholla available here.

While he was ordering coffee, I sat on a bench with decorative lights. Out of nowhere, an exposed, cut-open wire from those lights shocked me.
The jolt hurt that I felt pain right away, and my right leg cramped and went numb. What really surprised me, though, was how the staff handled it. When I told them what happened, all they said was, “Maaf ya, Kak,” without even asking if I was okay or showing much concern. Then they just taped a tissue napkin over the wire. That felt careless and unsafe, especially since the same thing could easily happen to another guest, even a child or an elderly person.
Please take a serious look at this issue. A little more care for your customers could prevent a much worse accident in the future. Sometimes a simple, “Are you okay?” or “How are you feeling?” can make all the difference. Just a little empathy goes a long way.";{'name': 'Anissa Chandra', 'link': 'https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114277902056500561349?hl=en-US', 'contributor_id': '114277902056500561349', 'thumbnail': 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWfZ2zYN-y-i4lnm4DklVuIhBtLxVmM6PBOulIxWiSMA6oKn4pI=s120-c-rp-mo-ba2-br100', 'local_guide': True, 'reviews': 12, 'photos': 10};;3 months ago

Although this coffee is not so wide but this shop has indoor and outdoor sitting area. It has four permanent outdoor tables and about three indoor removable tables. Those removable tables can be placed outside, it depends on where the customers want to sit. It provides manual brew and espresso-based drinks. For those who don't like coffee, this shop also provides non-coffee drinks such as tea, milktea, and milkshake. This shop also provides some snacks such as french fries, fried banana, and instant noodle. Cars can be parked on the side of the street near the shop, while motorcycles can be parked at the motorcycles parking area which is located around the Tugu Jogja. It has TV inside. However, I don't see any toilets here. Over all, it is good and recommended to chill out here.;{'name': 'Hairy Yusuf', 'link': 'https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101747449040864056718?hl=en-US', 'contributor_id': '101747449040864056718', 'thumbnail': 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWfWUzRdC6P1WDYFPc3slTkgx_IOQUscpZ-yOAA4X6IiMTJ1X4=s120-c-rp-mo-ba6-br100', 'local_guide': True, 'reviews': 569, 'photos': 2140};;6 years ago

Went here for the review and close to wisdom park for some bites.

Asked for omlette instead of sunny side up, rather dry and kinda expecting softer inside though, hence OK .
But then the baguette toasted sliced, were upsetting. They were THIN sliced. We checked and Looked the other posted photos and they came thicker slices. We dont mind getting 2 thicker slices but not like biscotti :(
We were thinking you guys run out the baguette hence did this.

Loko cafe located inside the Tugu Station. It’s kind of in the middle of the station, so it's reachable from either the West or East Gate of the station. The ambience feels vintage. It's pretty comfortable inside, in the morning it's not too hot nor cold.

There's a screen which shows us all of the train's schedules for the next hours. So we can relax inside the cafe without worrying about missing our train.

The coffee is good. The cashier and waitress are so nice and helpful. Btw, I really like the “bakpia” that they sold here. It’s called “Bakpia Kedaton”. If you like durian, then try the durian flavor, it is the best. Moreover, the bakpia is already halal certified.";{'name': 'Diana A', 'link': 'https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106432614619397736816?hl=en-US', 'contributor_id': '106432614619397736816', 'thumbnail': 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJk_MdEK32FOTa2T5fiq0W3nEqZGsKPggVgO5UZ4uhyx7ObdQ=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100', 'local_guide': True, 'reviews': 67, 'photos': 183};;10 months ago

# Harga terjangkau.

Cuman sayang ga ada music2
# Pelayanan untuk di kasir kurang menguasai menu. Sibuk dengan live entah itu bagian dari jobdisk nya juga kurng tau . Cuman pelayan di depan itu harus lebih responsif.

My two cents? I don’t think you need to use that much camphor balls in the toilet because it could cause dizziness and nausea, and the worst part is that the smell sticks to your clothes; not a nice souvenir to bring.

Would be great if you guys could improve on that and the cleanliness.

disappointing. I've been ordering through ShopeeFood since they offer great deals there (I pay Rp16.500 for a large size Kuro😆).

So far, I've tried the Hagia Creamy Latte (HCL), Kuro, and Mahija, all in large sizes. Each one brings a different experience:

- Mahija is definitely my favorite. It's slightly more bitter than Kuro and HCL, but still has that creamy texture. It reminded me a bit of Couve*, not as rich, but it hits a similar taste.

- Hagia Creamy Latte is, well just what it says: a creamy latte. Lighter than I expected but still strong enough to give you that caffeine boost and gemetar feeling.

- Kuro.....I am not really sure about this one. Not bad at all, but I haven't figured out what makes it stand out yet. Still, it's worth a try.

One thing I appreciate is that when you order a large, they give you an actual  large cup, so no misleading portion sizes here.

I'd love to visit the store in person, but what I have seen the vibe is very cement-grey minimalism. Personally, I crave more greenery in my coffee shop experience🙏🙂

Food prices range from Rp 5,500-40,000, drinks are also affordable: coffee, milkshake, float, juice, chocolate, there's even a juice & soda menu. I tried the fried rice and vanilla milkshake, the portions were just right, tasty, and cheap. The facilities are complete with free wifi, live music and even a meeting room and spacious parking. The downside is that when it's crowded, the service is a bit slow and the sound of games makes it a bit noisy if you want to focus. But overall it's legendary for hanging out, playing games, assignments, or community.;{'name': 'Cahaya Damanik', 'link': 'https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117660297447601711545?hl=en-US', 'contributor_id': '117660297447601711545', 'thumbnail': 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVQSkRmhXi6TSEGbYMtsBfJBxufzk31aK7Jm7SYNy-4xBsRqKEGKw=s120-c-rp-mo-br100', 'local_guide': True, 'reviews': 3, 'photos': 4};;4 months ago

It’s the vibes, the friendly staffs, the quite wide variety of foods and beverages, and especially the price. The place is old but comfortable and offers outdoor and indoor-air conditioned room. Spacious prayer room also available. Went for Sparkling Lychee Squash, Banana with Chocolate and Cheese, and Jakoru. Payment must be made first before orders are processed. Cash and non cash payment are available. Won’t say long lets the pictures do the talk.

Minus point is might be the parking lots, it’s using roadside and while it can accommodate many motorcycles only a handful cars can be parked here. Overall recommended.";{'name': 'Yulifar Widodo', 'link': 'https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111903205393231646991?hl=en-US', 'contributor_id': '111903205393231646991', 'thumbnail': 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXCV3jhkx4hhUJQB-Cbg2B3vfJva_hf9oOXQsNq79wWsrMVaVTfIQ=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100', 'local_guide': True, 'reviews': 128, 'photos': 409};;2 years ago

Walk in, and you're hit with vibes that are like a warm hug. Cozy, cool, and the kind of place where you can just hang out for hours without a care in the world.

Now, let's talk about the staff and the food. These guys aren't playing around. The staff? Friendly, helpful, and they make you feel like part of the crew. And the food? It's like a flavor explosion that'll have your taste buds doing a happy dance.

The waiters also made some unnecessary noises which shocked me and my friends. The inside sitting area is mixed with co-working space area and an uncomfortable thing happened. There were these boys and girls working on their things with their laptops, while my friends and I are chilling out, joking and laughing. Guess what!? One of ""the working boys"" was creeping at us with annoyed gaze. I guess this thing would happen again in future if they don't separate the co-working space. Oh yeah, one more thing, if you go here by a car and park your car at a side of the street in front of this coffee shop, you probably would get over-charged parking price by ""preman dressed in parking man suites around here"".

Malioboro;Karta Coffee & Eatery;4.7;536;Jl. Malioboro. 52-58, Suryatmajan, Danurejan Plaza Malioboro, Lt. 1 Unit 13-16, Kota Yogyakarta, Daerah Istimewa Yogyakarta 55213, Indonesia;4.0;"I accidentally found this cafe when I was already tired of eating at places like Solaria, HokBen, various Ramen shops, and similar chains. I've been to Jogja quite often, but I always stick to the Malioboro area, so I never get to try the authentic Jogja culinary scene, haha.

The place is on the ground floor of Malioboro Mall, right next to Wings Stop, literally in the corner. You can choose to dine inside or outside, where you can watch the hustle and bustle of Malioboro street.
The cafe is a bit dimly lit; it seems they have live music on certain nights because there’s a small stage area. The lighting is generally poor.

The staff weren't particularly friendly or quick to help. They didn't greet me warmly or even attempt to offer assistance when I was looking at the menu near the entrance and was clearly looking around for guidance.

So, I just walked in, chose a table, was handed a menu by staff, and went straight to the cashier to order and pay. When one menu item I wanted was sold out, the cashier didn't offer any alternatives or explanations until I asked which similar item they would recommend. Only then did they explain. So, they weren't proactive; they really need to improve their marketing skills.
However, the nice thing is that the food tasted good.

I ordered the Karta House Salad and Ayam Bakar Taliwang . Both tasted great.
The seasoning on the Ayam Taliwang was thoroughly absorbed; the chicken was incredibly easy to shred and enjoy just with a fork and spoon. The level of spiciness was just right, so was the savory flavor. It was truly delicious, beyond my expectation for a cafe located inside a mall.

The salad was also excellent. The dressing was simple but tasted healthy, not using mayonnaise based dressing. It seemed to be a perfect mix of olive oil, lemon, honey, salt, and pepper. The vegetables were fresh, and the protein sources were chicken and egg.
It was enjoyable, and I will definitely will come back to try other menus";{'name': 'Ivan -', 'link': 'https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111315427982079518415?hl=en-US', 'contributor_id': '111315427982079518415', 'thumbnail': 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWLah1OtZL4S-Or0eCgQUYT2WYXO7KRPx31OFQZWUyriDEw0jEA=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100', 'local_guide': True, 'reviews': 76, 'photos': 507};;2 months ago

One suggestion for the environment friendly, to not allow smoking area inside as in Malioboro itself, it is restricted area for smoker. There is also regulation from local gov to not allow anyone smoking in Malioboro area and this resto is in Malioboro but they allow smoker inside their resto which is not healthy for a non smoker ( pasive smoker).
If you want to have smoking area, make a room for smoker exacty same as in the airport so not harming other people life.

I tried the fried rice and vanilla milkshake, the portions were just right, tasty, and cheap. The facilities are complete with free wifi, live music and even a meeting room and spacious parking.

The barista was genuinely friendly and even offered me an Indonesian cigarette when he saw me smoking. He took the time to explain the different types of tobacco grown there.

I have to admit, Indonesia probably won’t conquer the global tobacco market — I gave him a mini Cuban cigar from my pack in return, which I’m sure he’s still recovering from — but they sure know how to make customers feel welcome.

They offer typical cafe menus. I once tried their Zomia English Breakfast, Mojito Squash, and Chocolate Milk Based. The Zomia English Breakfast tastes good, the mix vegetables tastes savoury. The Mojito Squash is very refreshing albeit being a little too sweet. Meanwhile, the Chocolate Milk Based is also good and quite thick. Their cookies are also thick and chewy. One downside of the drinks offered by Zomia is that the portions are relatively small.

There are indoor and outdoor seating areas in Zomia Co-Working Space. Indoor seating area is equipped with AC and I prefer sitting indoor as it is mosquito-free.

Yes you read right, this cafe is in the campus area. Even so, anyone can visit this cafe, not only for the UGM academic community

My first impression when arriving at this cafe is quite cool , because the cafe is surrounded by shady trees. Maybe it's because it's located in the Faculty of Forestry, so the feel of this cafe is like being in a forest (lol). The cafe is divided into two areas: indoor and outdoor. In the indoor area, you can enjoy the available dishes or just have a casual coffee on the soft couch. They also provide some books to read. The interior is minimalist & surrounded by wide glass.

Moving to the outdoor area, you can sit back in the bean bag or do your work on the various chair provided. The atmosphere is quite cozy and comfortable. I came at 9 am and coincidentally at that time it was still quiet, there were only 5 students.

The menu offered is varied, ranging from coffee, non-coffee, tea, snacks, and meals. The price itself still relatively cheap for students. I ordered a blueberry smoothie for IDR 18.000. I think the taste is worth the price, not so good but not that bad.

The drawbacks of this cafe are: it seems they don't provide a prayer room, the toilets are difficult to find, and the parking access is a bit confusing. For wifi connectivity, you can use the wifi provided by UGM.

Mostly visited by students, lecturer and faculty staff of Fisipol. Talking about the food and beverage, i would say they're very good. Not bad at all. The service is also nice. The waitress will serve you patiently. Most of the customer would get confused with the ordering method at their first time. But worry not as i told you, the waitress are at your service. Very affordable as well. The price are very reasonable. However, they have a very limited space for the guest. The capacity can only afford 20-30 people.

It's kinda quiet most of the time, which makes it perfect for getting stuff done, especially for students who need to focus.

They've got plenty of plugs for charging your gadgets, although some of them might be a bit wonky and need fixing.

They close up shop on the second floor and main area around 3 PM, but you can still hang out on the top floor until 5 PM, which is cool if you need more time to work or study.

Overall, Digilib Cafe is a comfy place to get things done, whether you're working remotely or cramming for exams. It's definitely worth checking out if you need a change of scenery for your study sessions or work days.";{'name': 'Monidhiya Annaufal', 'link': 'https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111522477467830244264?hl=en-US', 'contributor_id': '111522477467830244264', 'thumbnail': 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWNedkmF7uAUhTVBfq2iSNRVdn3Qv7xTbXRRPZkpEC0K3hUak3m=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100', 'local_guide': True, 'reviews': 36, 'photos': 48};;a year ago

In addition to a comfortable place, of course the baristas are friendly. This cafe is located above the Fisipol Mandiri Bank, you can enter from the lobby or from the Mandiri Bank.

The service was good, and the staff were friendly and welcoming. The indoor seating is air-conditioned, making it a good spot for working on your laptop, though I found the seating a bit uncomfortable for extended work sessions. The outdoor space isn’t too large but offers a nice option for a quick hangout.

However, I wouldn’t recommend visiting during the day since it’s located on the side of a busy road, which can get noisy and distracting.";{'name': 'Nastititanya Widetasha', 'link': 'https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110832167376162773985?hl=en-US', 'contributor_id': '110832167376162773985', 'thumbnail': 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjU5tdzmNkpCWzp3tCHjv4cs_mlLSuVJUheF_XJMQLvw-cHkXCfCMw=s120-c-rp-mo-ba6-br100', 'local_guide': True, 'reviews': 119, 'photos': 1242};;a year ago

The price is quite expensive for many people. The average price for a cup of cold drink is 30k, as well as for snack.

They offer good typical cafe foods and drinks. I tried their pasta and chocolate milk. The pasta tastes fresh and unique although a little bit dry. The chocolate milk is great.

I especially love the little corner next to the counter dedicated to making filter coffee. The design is subtle yet thoughtful, combining earthy tones with an industrial feel, which ties in perfectly with their brand, Lantai Bumi (Earth Floor).

And let’s not forget the coffee—it’s far from just being pretty for the 'gram. Their coffee is genuinely delicious, not the kind of mediocre brew you sometimes find in stylish cafés.

I ordered a butterscotch latte, basically a coffee drink with espresso mixed with milk and flavored with butterscotch syrup.

On top of that, the atmosphere was really crowded and poorly organized, which made the whole experience even more frustrating.;{'name': 'leo faris', 'link': 'https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110024151951535456669?hl=en-US', 'contributor_id': '110024151951535456669', 'thumbnail': 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKEz_FbewwRpB8xHHDNDxZcwH1tG3nMIYXnVW45xWzYBAKqWQ=s120-c-rp-mo-br100', 'local_guide': True, 'reviews': 12, 'photos': 3};;6 months ago

Candrakirana No.21, Terban, Gondokusuman, Yogyakarta City, Special Region of Yogyakarta 55223, Indonesia;5.0;"Walking into My Kopi O feels like stepping into one of those places that simply gets it right. The space is wide and versatile, you can hide inside with the cool air, or sit outside and light up, feeling the breeze kiss your skin. Either way, it's the kind of spot that can host everything: late brunches, group hangouts, or even those long reflective evenings when you just want to sit with your thoughts.

And the portions? oh darling, they don't play small here. Every plate arrives like a promise, and before you know it, you're torn between finishing everything or surrendering gracefully. Some dishes are so generously served, the plates themselves come out long, wide, and bold... leaving you to wonder if the chef was secretly winking at us all.

But what truly seals the deal is their signature ES TEH TARIK. Creamy frothy, irresistibly sweet, something about it lingers like a kiss you're not ready to let go of.

In the end, My Kopi O isn't just about food. It's about indulgence, laughter that echoes across the room, and reminder that sometimes the best meals aren't measured by calories, but by the way they make you feel alive.";{'name': 'Lapansonindra LA', 'link': 'https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101637166567677415107?hl=en-GB', 'contributor_id': '101637166567677415107', 'thumbnail': 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjU2HyUit4xK2H6Bgcw-UP3HgX5rG-g7ZLutnlk8dRLToU3obCUB=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100', 'local_guide': True, 'reviews': 117, 'photos': 614};;3 months ago

Too bad I didn’t have a chance to ask her for her name because by the time we’re leaving she’s not at the door anymore.
I’m so impressed with the service provided because they even remember to serve the ice cream for the child menu after the meal! They’re actively confirming, I honestly forgotten already.
The kaya toast could be better I guess (the butter & kaya ratio is off, too much kaya too little butter) but the coffee was top notch.

What I love about Couvee too is how bold and creamy their coffee tastes. Plus, they let you pick a no sugar or non-sweet option. That means a lot to me, since I try to stay away from too much sugar for health reasons.

It’s okay if you want to create “a budget packaged meal” butt can you imagine this meal only fill of ONIONSS?!! Like what? I bought to get rice with the meat, but got none. I asked to the barista/cashier and she said “iyaa kaa sop nyaa gitu” likewhat? I even couldnt find the meat on my meal haha.
So please for the owner, if you want to create “budget murah”, please tetep jaga kualitas juga. I can say like this because my parents also run fnb
Hope this cafe will be better and wanna come again if there is improvement 🙏

p.s: i forced myself to eat this because i dont waste anything

The AC is really good, the wifi is also ok. The printer  connects by cable, and they sell paper for printing (IDR 500/paper).

The food and drink  quality is 4, its good but not perfect. The drink is too sweet tho, so make sure you order less sugar if you wont have oversweet.

I agreed to how the taste and also the effect of caffeine. However, they tend to give more than 1 shot, I think thats why the taste was bold.

For the atmosphere, I do enjoy the venue however, the playlist is somehow inappropriate for working (esp the one who seeks quiet place). And some corner too messy with mop at in front of toilet, and also leak pipe in west part. But when you seek for discussing I think they provide what you need.

So when I went last time, I experienced the server did some inconvenient. So actually, cosan only provide the coffee. And they do not give a sign that it is forbidden to bring meal outside. The cokies shop is not affiliated with cosan (ive asked them). And there was a customer who brought their own lunch, eat outside (smoking area) which in my opinion it was polite. But then cosan server just make loud announcement via speaker witn AI voice for reminding for not eating the food from outside. Well, I didnt know whether they already warned directly or not, but still for me it is impolite for reminding with such way which the customer received sidelong glance from other customers.

I just suggested to put a sign for not allowing bring outside food. Second, they might warn direct and private to customer. And the last step is given fined to them who disobeys that.

The staff is so nice. Easily to see them smiling to customers.

And anytime you leave the shop, they’ll say thank you for all of you. Very kind of them.

Coffee was pretty good, with a nice selection of options on the menu.

Food was quite disappointing - we ordered fries with sausage which was a bit of a letdown for 32K IDR. Hopefully the other food options are better but we didn't dare to spend any more money on food here.

The staff also rarely seemed to be at the counter, and instead were often just chilling in the back room, which made it a bit frustrating whenever we wanted to order more drinks.

Another notable potential downside is that the cafe is quite small and quiet, so the noise from the staff using the blender etc. is very noticeable.

Nevertheless, a generally decent choice for WFC. Cozier than a lot of alternatives in the area, but has a few areas for improvement.";{'name': 'Bebek', 'link': 'https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113170000079446204881?hl=en-US', 'contributor_id': '113170000079446204881', 'thumbnail': 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWhwdsCmzfUZ1k2Cd3BQT3VINUf_EnhRRWiRjcV4aUuzKYTR3hY=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100', 'local_guide': True, 'reviews': 49, 'photos': 94};;a month ago
Seturan;BR Coffee;4.5;449;Jl. Seturan Raya No.15, Kledokan, Caturtunggal, Kec. Depok, Kabupaten Sleman, Daerah Istimewa Yogyakarta 55281, Indonesia;5.0;I have tried many coworking space-themed cafes in Yogyakarta, but none of them satisfy my needs until I found BR Coffee. Most cafes here are heavily visited with smokers, which as a non-smoker I prefer a designated area and this cafe has it. The couch seat was comfy to support my 8-9 hrs work. I am quite tall myself, so I prefer not to slouch during work, hence the adequate height of the table is required and this cafe had it. While I prefer white and bright lighting, the café's light was not too dim. There was a chatty couple sitting next to me, but as long as you brought your headphones, even the loudest noises won't bother you. The wifi was swift. The café's music selection was good (majorly bossanova genre). There is a praying room for Muslims adjacent to the entrance of Budi Mulia school. I ordered dine-in choco frappe (10/10), fish & chips (7.5/10, fish tasted a bit soggy but passable, the chips were great), and had a take-way creme brulé (9/10). When I arrived there at 10, the waiter was & the computer was not 100% ready to serve (including the food menu). Whether you order dine in or take out, I believe the speed of service could have taken some improvement. But it was okay, it's just a small let down. Nevertheless I would visit this place again and highly recommend it to anyone.;{'name': 'Feisal Dirgantara', 'link': 'https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113079832274418754271?hl=en-US', 'contributor_id': '113079832274418754271', 'thumbnail': 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUtqUreLA7jqtYT4b4XWYiCSPeYxfb7RzVEfX7vbHmyxbRSux0=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100', 'local_guide': True, 'reviews': 24, 'photos': 134};;a year ago

After waiting for a full 20 minutes I had to go back and ring the bell again and she came and I asked her where is our order? only then she actually started making the coffees which took her another 10 minutes.

And they many visitor to come in this café, this café getting popular for domestic tourist even the location in northern of Yogyakarta take one hours from down town. Even though the location is easy to reach, parking space is very limited here. But you can parking your car on the side of road 🚗, its better you just bring motorcycle..

The service is like a common place, the waiters will giving you the menu and you write what your option to order. They have a lot variation of food, but mainly for wester menu like breed, pizza or toast. You must patient if ordering pizza because they claim they don't make instant pizza and they baked directly if you make order, and they have a lot kind of beverage for coffe and non coffe. For the food quality is so good and the taste is really nice especially Pizza offcourse ✨

Even they have a lot of costumer but the seat setting not to dense, no to much table in indoor area, mostly in outdoor plus the weather in Kaliurang cool and calm, it will great optional to casual chat.. and when you walk behind the café you will see the garden, tree house and some space for praying (for muslim). The restroom and enviroment is total clean and well maintenance. Because this place beautiful so many people come just for take some picture..

Beware of monkey 🐒, because a lot population of monkey and they have tendencies to looking for some food outside the forest, you may see some mokey in here but not everytime they come..

The minus for this café just the price is quiet higher for Yogyakarta people 😹, but it's still worth if you have great experience and taste a delicious food.. it can be seen from the many visitor come here, I think the price is not really matters for lifestyle Jogja society..

Finally I give 5/5 ratting for Rumah Rasa Kaliurang 🙌, I hope they still keep the quality of service and provide a much car parking 👍";{'name': 'Izra', 'link': 'https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108869975644373243926?hl=en-GB', 'contributor_id': '108869975644373243926', 'thumbnail': 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWoRE-jK5u4yelpzu_vzzpFOAbnFCjV1JXt2nmtO-2AjkxrVATA=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100', 'local_guide': True, 'reviews': 135, 'photos': 291};;5 months ago

Kaliurang;Fore Coffee - Kaliurang;4.4;1965;Kaliurang St No.KM 5, Karang Wuni, Caturtunggal, Depok, Sleman Regency, Special Region of Yogyakarta 55153, Indonesia;5.0;"My favourite working space cafe in Yogyakarta! What I like the most is they open very early (very hard to find this opening time in Yogyakarta) and the coffee is very very good. So I can start my day to get good coffee early.

They have various options for coffee and all of them are very good. They also have vegetarian options.

The location is very easy to access, the layout setting is very nice, multiple seating in different types which helps you to make decisions either you will work alone, small desk, bigger desk, inside with cooler AC, indoor mezzanine with warmer temperatures and also non smoking area.

The wifi is pretty stable, the music is soft and helps my focus better and the service is excellent.

Overall, very recommended cafe and my suggestion is come early to get better seats.

Kons:
1. Its pricey compared to other, but they have the best coffee
2. Somehow looping music isn’t fun to listen to
3. No praying room";{'name': 'iing muttakhiroh', 'link': 'https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103867081864623995499?hl=en-US', 'contributor_id': '103867081864623995499', 'thumbnail': 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjW-ieSP5qwMQozsWkNElBc73aPy16FlFzUjGo5SscVM4wtZPpFd=s120-c-rp-mo-ba6-br100', 'local_guide': True, 'reviews': 173, 'photos': 1610};;Edited a year ago

Kaliurang;Fore Coffee - Kaliurang;4.4;1965;Kaliurang St No.KM 5, Karang Wuni, Caturtunggal, Depok, Sleman Regency, Special Region of Yogyakarta 55153, Indonesia;5.0;Disclaimer: I went here twice, at 9.45 PM and 7.30 AM. This review will be very subjective. I still give 5 stars, here's why: just like other Fore store, cozy yet pleasant, nice ambience, and great taste of coffee! Serving time is actually good.. but during the opening period it seems slow serving, crowded, noisy, and echoing. Hence, I suggest you to try after the hype is over. Pricing is reasonable, considering this coffeeshop origin is from big city, the proper packaging, and the location. Place is quite spacious, there's lot of power sockets, but the air conditioner is too cold, so mind your clothes if you wanna stay for long. Parking lot is a little bit hassle for car owner.;{'name': 'Qonita Aulia Rahma', 'link': 'https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102221469639550260081?hl=en-US', 'contributor_id': '102221469639550260081', 'thumbnail': 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKKIw1skZg8kDBwQl-oq_thtg168NHeFiKV_9_2ifwfYeRI8us=s120-c-rp-mo-ba6-br100', 'local_guide': True, 'reviews': 410, 'photos': 1736};;Edited 4 years ago

The menu is based on traditional Javanese home-style cooking, and overall the food tastes good. The prices are also very affordable. One of the highlights is the location that surrounded by paddy fields, it offers a pleasant countryside atmosphere that feels calm and refreshing.
However, the main downside is how crowded this place gets. Because it uses a buffet system, you have to queue to get your food, and if you come at the wrong time, the wait can easily be 15–25 minutes or more. Seating is also quite limited during busy hours, making it hard to find a place to sit and eat comfortably. The best time to visit is either right when they open or during the last hours before closing.
One major issue that really stood out to me is hygiene and etiquette. The workers often walk on the carpeted seating area while wearing sandals. This is uncomfortable to see, especially since customers are clearly careful not to step on the carpets because they are meant for sitting and eating. It’s quite concerning to think that the sandals may have stepped on dirt or even chicken droppings outside, and then onto the same area where people sit and eat. This practice feels unhygienic and should definitely be addressed.";{'name': 'Richard Mahendra', 'link': 'https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101628363912705202013?hl=en-US', 'contributor_id': '101628363912705202013', 'thumbnail': 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXjk7upojoKaGJ5bR1bZy-And6Ds9tNaImYESSy3NB-N3Se5dOw=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100', 'local_guide': True, 'reviews': 153, 'photos': 364};;a week ago

Kaliurang;BROEDER Coffee - Jalan Kaliurang;4.7;117;Jl. Kaliurang No.80 A, Kocoran, Caturtunggal, Kec. Depok, Kabupaten Sleman, Daerah Istimewa Yogyakarta 55281, Indonesia;5.0;"BROEDER Coffee

📍 Lokasi & Konsep
BROEDER Coffee berlokasi di Jalan Kaliurang, salah satu kawasan nongkrong favorit di Yogyakarta. Kafe ini punya konsep fun dan minimalis dengan interior berwarna biru-oranye cerah serta mural karakter kucing khas BROEDER yang membuat suasana terasa playful dan ceria.
Tempatnya tidak terlalu besar, tetapi tertata rapi dengan area indoor ber-AC dan outdoor kecil untuk duduk santai.

🍽 Menu yang Dipesan
- Asmaja – Rp 21.000: minuman berbasis asam jawa + aroma bunga.
- Milk Tea – Rp 23.000: teh susu dengan aroma bunga.
Pembayaran dilakukan lewat QRIS (cashless) sehingga praktis.

👅 Rasa & Kualitas
- Asmaja: Rasa asam jawa terasa ringan, aroma bunga memberi sentuhan unik yang membuat minuman jadi terasa lebih “khas” dan tidak biasa.
- Milk Tea: Teh susu dengan aroma bunga juga jadi pilihan yang menarik — rasa susu lembut berpadu dengan aroma floral yang membuat minuman ini terasa lebih special dibanding milk tea biasa.
- Kedua minuman menunjukkan bahwa BROEDER Coffee punya variasi menu yang kreatif dan tidak sekadar kopi/teh standar.
💬 Sebenarnya datang ke sini untuk ngopi, tapi saat itu menu kopi sedang habis. Untungnya pilihan non-coffee-nya tetap menarik dan enak!

🪑 Suasana & Fasilitas
- Ruang indoor nyaman dengan AC, kursi dan meja yang cukup untuk nongkrong.
- Interior modern dan bersih; cocok untuk hangout bersama teman atau kerja santai.
- Karena lokasi di Jl. Kaliurang (area cukup strategis) aksesnya mudah.
- Yang menarik, BROEDER Coffee buka 24 jam, jadi cocok banget buat kamu yang cari tempat ngopi (atau non-coffee) malam-malam.

💰 Harga & Value
Harga minuman Rp 21.000 dan Rp 23.000 cukup standar untuk coffee shop di kota besar seperti Yogyakarta termasuk dalam range yang wajar untuk minuman dengan konsep dan rasa kreatif.
Value-nya: cukup baik karena kamu mendapatkan rasa berbeda (aroma bunga) dan suasana nyaman.

💳 Pembayaran
Pembayaran dilakukan lewat QRIS (cashless) sesuai pengalamanku. Hal ini mendukung kenyamanan transaksi.

I visited on a weekend and was pleased to find no queue, which was a positive sign. The ambiance of the place was charming with a vintage vibe, creating a unique atmosphere.

However, when it came to the food, it didn't stand out for me personally. The dishes were quite spicy, which I struggled with since I'm not a fan of extremely spicy food.

This typical restaurant signature is crispy egg (telur gimbal) and crispy fried tempe mendoan. Of course self- service main course are mangut asap, goreng, soun which comes spicy, lodeh and vegetable soup. Very rich tasted, mangut asap is my fave

The ambience is traditional javanese omah joglo they have one main joglo in the center and its right wing where you can order tempe, pukis and telor gimbal. They have lesehan area and few saung/ small pendopo at the back. Small musholla is in the left side of the main joglo

We came at the 4th Day of Lebaran holiday, for these crowded daya their service is quite quick with arrival time 11 pm.

Though we stop here by accident (the famous toko sebelah the klotokan is insanely queuing) yet i satisfied with our family lunch. Such a saviour. One thing i missed is they dont serve crispy banana fried  but they have this carabiking with taste of jackfruit";{'name': 'Nisma Mediya', 'link': 'https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103145997399203274254?hl=en-US', 'contributor_id': '103145997399203274254', 'thumbnail': 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUqndW6KIXg2QL7aWsxRYJ9aTxK3_1e4B3-W-O0kmwR_xdX45VKNw=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100', 'local_guide': True, 'reviews': 149, 'photos': 1136};;a year ago

We were headed to Kopi K itself. But we didn't get any place to park our Hiace. I thought it was one management for Kopi.

Suprisingly, it was 9am in the morning. Many tourists came for breakfast, using cars also bikes. Nice! Super crowded for any place call KOPI in this area. Because the place surrounded with nature view- mountain, grass field, fresh air, villager area.

Food - that no spicy : Telur Crispy, Tempe Mendoan,  ( our children, only ate these. beside the snack Coro Bikang.

Other than that, all the foods are spicy- I mean really spicy ^__^

Taste good, my fave of course that spicy MANGUT LELE asap + Gori - sayur nangka ( lucky me, my gastric was OKAY).

Other than the space, to ber very honest nothing special. The coffee is so-so and no non-dairy milk option. The food quality also so-so. Not bad but nothing special. Yeah, they need to upgrade their food and beverage quality.

The interior theme aligns with the cafe name, Kaktus. There are kaktus in the parking lot and on the tables. Anywhere.

Also there are hanging plants on the indoor ceiling. It gives the serene ambience.

The menu are various with reasonable price. There's also packed ice cream in a display freezer, which is interesting; but I forgot to buy it at the end because I was too tired.

I ordered mix platter and iced salted caramel latte with extra shot of espresso. The food's came in a big portion and variation. The drink's good because it's not too sweet--maybe because of the extra shot.

There are many seating options; outdoor and indoor. Upstairs or downstairs.

The parking is not free, but spacious.

Unfortunately, there's one major snag: the parking attendants. There were four of them outside, and they were constantly blowing their whistles at ear-splitting levels. It completely shattered the relaxed atmosphere the coffee shop works so hard to create. It's a shame because otherwise, this place would easily be a 5-star haven.

Tempatnya cozy, ada 2 lantai ( atas outdoor, bawah indoor) tapi aku lebih prefer di indoor karena diatas panas banget terutama siang bolong. Oiya, di sudut ruangan indoor ada kaca yang cukup estetik buat kalian foto. Lumayan buat foto ala-ala yekan..
Pelayanan oke, gercep, staff ramah, komunikatif memberi saran minuman kalau kita bingung.

Waktu kesana ada promo, beli 2 cuma bayar 35K untuk varian kopi susu. 40k untuk varian kopi tertentu (lupa apa). Untuk dari segi harga dia standardnya coffee lah ya, rasanya beuhh mantap. Aku cobain kopi susunya, enak. Unik.

The last drink not really bad but im not satisfied its out my expectations. For totally our spending its not win win with the our order.

Servers are really friendly. The upstairs floor is non smoking.
Wait times for food is around 15mins....but go early as this place is quite popular with the younger university crowds and can get pretty full up...esp on the weekends. Tranding on social media currently.

Other than the space, to ber very honest nothing special. The coffee is so-so and no non-dairy milk option. The food quality also so-so. Not bad but nothing special. Yeah, they need to upgrade their food and beverage quality.

Also there are hanging plants on the indoor ceiling. It gives the serene ambience.

The menu are various with reasonable price. There's also packed ice cream in a display freezer, which is interesting; but I forgot to buy it at the end because I was too tired.

I ordered mix platter and iced salted caramel latte with extra shot of espresso. The food's came in a big portion and variation. The drink's good because it's not too sweet--maybe because of the extra shot.

There are many seating options; outdoor and indoor. Upstairs or downstairs.

jd tuh tempatnya ada di sebelah kiri, deket lampu merah congcat. emg agak sulit kalo mau kesini tp engga ambil sisi kiri soalnya biasanya jalanan daerah sini rame polll. trus ini cafe tempatnya agak menjorok kedalem, agak rawan kebablasan dikit tp ancer2nya gampang kokk

untuk makanannya enakk wlpn harganya agak pricey tp worth it di tempat yg estetik ini. untuk minumannya juga enak, jd dapet cup sendiri gitu, kalo misal engga habis bisa lsg dibawa pulang jd gausab repot2 buat minta barista bungkusin 😆

suasananya estetik bgttt. remang2 gitu. enak buat nugas. apalagi ada stop kontak dan meja besarr yg bisa kamu pake buay nugas rame2, trus ada juga yg buat sekedar nongki2 cantikk juga. dan ada juga meja kursi yg disetting saling berhadapan tapi susunan kursinya buat sharing ke cs lain gituu. apalagi banyak spot foto estetik yg harus kamu coba, pun ada kaca bwsarr disitu, jd gaperlu rebutan sama yang lain yaaa

untuk musholla ada kok gaiss di bagian bawah, tinggal turun tangga trus ikutin jalan ajahh. jangan kawatir kl gabawa mukena, dsni disediain kokk. saran, mungkin bisa di bangun tempat wudhu yg isinya cukup buat 5 orangan. soalnya kalau cuma satu dan pas rame pasti agak ribet 😁🙏

oiya untuk parkir aman banget gess. parkirnya luas, dan ada tempat parkir mobil jg di bagian bawah jadi amann

overall rekomended bgtt buay nugas dan kegiatan lain. baristanya pun ramah2 dan selalu senyum kokk 😁";{'name': 'Nazila Basuin', 'link': 'https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116403217343476120888?hl=en-US', 'contributor_id': '116403217343476120888', 'thumbnail': 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUTBoBq_TQWu5ifV82_zkVs_RBd4H5U7lBS4nwuzewVAA6-sJ8=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100', 'local_guide': True, 'reviews': 56, 'photos': 399};;8 months ago

Kebetulan karena saya kemari di penghujung akhir Oktober jadi ada menu khusus halloween/Spooktober special limited time menu, yakni Pumpkin Spice Latte dan Chocolate web donut (regular donut). Saya pesan Pumpkin spices latte, ini enak banget menurutku rasanya sangat balance, karena espresso coffee nya bold dan strong (double shot espresso) rasa pumpkin dan spices (cinnamon sugar dan lotus biscoff crumble nya terasa pas) kombinasi yang unik namun enak banget, saya suka (rate dari saya: perfect combination (both strong and bold coffee too) and great coffee receips/10).

Donutnya awalnya saya kira donut susu, ternyata setelah saya coba ini tipikal donut kentang, tapi enak banget, apalagi tanpa kita request untuk dihangatkan langsung di microwave sama baristanya, donutnya empuk, manisnya pas, dan lembut rasanya mirip donut D**n**n d*n*t, cokelatnya juga enak gak bikin eneg (rate dari saya 10/10).

Sekian review jujur dari saya, Overall worth it dan recommended, ada menu Sandwich, dan non kopi juga, free parkirking area.

Bisa juga dipesan via:
✅Shopee food, grab fiod, dan go food.

Metode pembayaran yang bisa dilakukan:
✅QRIS, Cash, dan Debit";{'name': 'Rahman the unique explorer', 'link': 'https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114829140751356663973?hl=en-US', 'contributor_id': '114829140751356663973', 'thumbnail': 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKILOyh4kmbHabydnjq1IohtgDdq66kA6MUxHwq_Kta6B3Oeqlb=s120-c-rp-mo-ba7-br100', 'local_guide': True, 'reviews': 584, 'photos': 5365};;Edited a year ago

Gejayan;RICY Eatery & Coffee;4.7;1250;Gejayan, Condong Catur, Depok, Sleman Regency, Special Region of Yogyakarta, Indonesia;3.0;For a business meeting, I was advised to visit Ricy Eatery on Ring Road Jogjakarta. Upon arrival, I found the staff appeared preoccupied and were not readily available to offer a warm welcome. I ordered a cappuccino, which looked appealing but was served lukewarm. A second request for a hot coffee yielded the same result. The eatery itself is quite large, featuring a stage and space for large groups, including a second-floor area. While the venue has potential for events, the overall atmosphere felt uninviting. Due to these issues with service and temperature, I would not choose this location again.;"{'name': ""Gijs' Reviews"", 'link': 'https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107995366910540455995?hl=en-US', 'contributor_id': '107995366910540455995', 'thumbnail': 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjX9OjuT4ChpBV0ZOcRqutvc0aIiDLrrs3LexfLHUFaEKZecKBQ=s120-c-rp-mo-ba7-br100', 'local_guide': True, 'reviews': 650, 'photos': 7700}";;3 months ago

Unfortunately, there's one major snag: the parking attendants. There were four of them outside, and they were constantly blowing their whistles at ear-splitting levels. It completely shattered the relaxed atmosphere the coffee shop works so hard to create. It's a shame because otherwise, this place would easily be a 5-star haven.

BBQ wings a bit spicy, should be no problem if you love spicy food.
I personally love the Sunny Side egg, even this is a very simple dish but the way they cook it made it taste extra ordinary ☺
The price is very reasonable, totally recommend 👍";{'name': 'Piter Halim', 'link': 'https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113786211044480188651?hl=en-GB', 'contributor_id': '113786211044480188651', 'thumbnail': 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXa4v134gqOQsiI7KHBurC3RbXjuqrtaLjs3Lyer4-Tyg7jReGxqA=s120-c-rp-mo-ba6-br100', 'local_guide': True, 'reviews': 497, 'photos': 2347};;8 months ago

It’s got this open, airy layout with a mix of concrete, greenery, and cozy corners that make it feel both modern and laid-back.

Perfect for grabbing food (Los Ciken of korz), hanging out, or just chilling with a drink.

The vibes are super relaxed and it's kind of like a hidden outdoor hangout with just the right amount of buzz.

Definitely one of those places you wanna keep coming back to. 🤤🤤🤤";{'name': 'Hana Kurnia', 'link': 'https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114965741347454355392?hl=en-GB', 'contributor_id': '114965741347454355392', 'thumbnail': 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVr1MJuXN7O3GH0SlF2T1praqZFenL2lWS4gJPCgJUT3Z6rGCVE=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100', 'local_guide': True, 'reviews': 66, 'photos': 20};;6 months ago

First off, I have to give a shout-out to Los Ciken, the Nashville chicken, is fantastic. The service was a big upgrade comparing at their old Palagan location, it used to take forever, but I got my order in less than 10 minutes this time. Really impressed!
On the flip side, I’m a bit bummed about the new space for Lumi. It feels smaller and more cramped than before. One of the things I loved most about the old Lumi was the beautiful kind a look like paddy view. It was such a nice, relaxing spot to enjoy coffee, and now that’s gone. It just doesn’t have the same vibe anymore. Because it feels cramped and there’s no more paddy view, I decided to take my order to go.";{'name': 'corvus', 'link': 'https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114023647887141923642?hl=en-GB', 'contributor_id': '114023647887141923642', 'thumbnail': 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVpkeGLSI1Bj2jgG3z53rbS1z0oa34i-0OTws2YJEjT6k_6684=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100', 'local_guide': True, 'reviews': 237, 'photos': 176};;a year ago

Some people come to this place to do some college stuff (study, do project) and most people that come to this place maybe around 19-25 y.o

What i notice about this shop is that they have some concept as similar with famous jakarta coffee shop brand named tuku. From the font, tiny detail ornament, some menus. I believe i see one thread about this on twitter. But it's not problem for me, just hope they have their own authenticity.

That really ruined the experience for me. Service was decent and the food came out quickly as long as the line wasn’t too long.

I ordered a butterscotch latte, basically a coffee drink with espresso mixed with milk and flavored with butterscotch syrup. The syrup gives it a caramel-like sweetness with a buttery note, which pairs nicely with the bitterness of the espresso. It’s smooth and creamy, but depending on taste, some might find it a little too sweet after a few sips.";{'name': 'Another Ricky', 'link': 'https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101223597974673710056?hl=en-US', 'contributor_id': '101223597974673710056', 'thumbnail': 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVXHaTr2VWwbgiZn4Cx_3L2BDypNUArAuy20H7xu0FA56tkRLQ=s120-c-rp-mo-ba7-br100', 'local_guide': True, 'reviews': 427, 'photos': 2708};;2 months ago

The staff here are friendly, they greet customers walking in, but the wait times for the drinks can be slightly long. Additionally, the staff can wander around, especially in the 1st floor, so it can be slightly disturbing. As for the foods and drinks, tried one of their latte, which is pistachio, that comes with a tiramisu on top. It's definitely a different experience with the twist they have on the drink.

What I like the most is they open very early (very hard to find this opening time in Yogyakarta) and the coffee is very very good. So I can start my day to get good coffee early.

They have various options for coffee and all of them are very good. They also have vegetarian options.

The location is very easy to access, the layout setting is very nice, multiple seating in different types which helps you to make decisions either you will work alone, small desk, bigger desk, inside with cooler AC, indoor mezzanine with warmer temperatures and also non smoking area.

The wifi is pretty stable, the music is soft and helps my focus better and the service is excellent.

Overall, very recommended cafe and my suggestion is come early to get better seats.

Kons:
1. Its pricey compared to other, but they have the best coffee
2. Somehow looping music isn’t fun to listen to
3. No praying room";{'name': 'iing muttakhiroh', 'link': 'https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103867081864623995499?hl=en-US', 'contributor_id': '103867081864623995499', 'thumbnail': 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjW-ieSP5qwMQozsWkNElBc73aPy16FlFzUjGo5SscVM4wtZPpFd=s120-c-rp-mo-ba6-br100', 'local_guide': True, 'reviews': 173, 'photos': 1610};;Edited a year ago

This review will be very subjective. I still give 5 stars, here's why: just like other Fore store, cozy yet pleasant, nice ambience, and great taste of coffee! Serving time is actually good.. but during the opening period it seems slow serving, crowded, noisy, and echoing. Hence, I suggest you to try after the hype is over. Pricing is reasonable, considering this coffeeshop origin is from big city, the proper packaging, and the location. Place is quite spacious, there's lot of power sockets, but the air conditioner is too cold, so mind your clothes if you wanna stay for long.

Firstly product was okay ish but not the best coffee you would get for the price.

the staff at the cashier isn’t knowledgeable about the product offered at the menu. Didn’t memorise the menu nor understand the flavour’s of the product they recommended to me. luckily the barista helped out after some time of confusion.

and this is.. the biggest problem… the women’s toilet on the 2nd floor? utterly disgusting. what do you expect when you don’t place a trash bin inside the toilet stall? of course people will leave used tissues scattered all over. I bet the staff also barely checks on the toilets to clean up too.

i know this review is written weeks after the opening but man.. for the price of your coffee please do better";{'name': 'Pitrakanya Risa', 'link': 'https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101652418383055569212?hl=en-US', 'contributor_id': '101652418383055569212', 'thumbnail': 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWJ1MK5BuW9hqa58f1sj5Qk1RjfUqTg4uopRRDb1q-1ZmQSKm-dHA=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100', 'local_guide': True, 'reviews': 30, 'photos': 17};;a year ago

And they many visitor to come in this café, this café getting popular for domestic tourist even the location in northern of Yogyakarta take one hours from down town. Even though the location is easy to reach, parking space is very limited here. But you can parking your car on the side of road 🚗, its better you just bring motorcycle..

The service is like a common place, the waiters will giving you the menu and you write what your option to order. They have a lot variation of food, but mainly for wester menu like breed, pizza or toast. You must patient if ordering pizza because they claim they don't make instant pizza and they baked directly if you make order, and they have a lot kind of beverage for coffe and non coffe. For the food quality is so good and the taste is really nice especially Pizza offcourse ✨

Even they have a lot of costumer but the seat setting not to dense, no to much table in indoor area, mostly in outdoor plus the weather in Kaliurang cool and calm, it will great optional to casual chat.. and when you walk behind the café you will see the garden, tree house and some space for praying (for muslim). The restroom and enviroment is total clean and well maintenance. Because this place beautiful so many people come just for take some picture..

Beware of monkey 🐒, because a lot population of monkey and they have tendencies to looking for some food outside the forest, you may see some mokey in here but not everytime they come..

The minus for this café just the price is quiet higher for Yogyakarta people 😹, but it's still worth if you have great experience and taste a delicious food.. it can be seen from the many visitor come here, I think the price is not really matters for lifestyle Jogja society..

Finally I give 5/5 ratting for Rumah Rasa Kaliurang 🙌, I hope they still keep the quality of service and provide a much car parking 👍";{'name': 'Izra', 'link': 'https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108869975644373243926?hl=en-GB', 'contributor_id': '108869975644373243926', 'thumbnail': 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWoRE-jK5u4yelpzu_vzzpFOAbnFCjV1JXt2nmtO-2AjkxrVATA=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100', 'local_guide': True, 'reviews': 135, 'photos': 291};;5 months ago
