"One of the coffee shops located in Malioboro street. This place has a variety of drinks, snacks, and dishes to try. We tried one of their mocktails, it tastes okay and has a reasonable price. We also tried some of their snacks, such as the Tahu Cabe Garam, which has nice flavours. The place has indoors and semi-outdoors, with smoking and non-smoking areas, and has nice ambience. The staff here are friendly, and the foods and drinks came out relatively quickly. Overall, a good option to visit in Malioboro.",one coffee shops located malioboro street place variety drinks snacks dishes try tried one mocktails tastes okay reasonable price also tried snacks cabe garam nice flavours place indoors semi outdoors smoking non smoking areas nice ambience staff friendly foods drinks came relatively quickly overall good option visit malioboro

"It’s an okay place to hang out, but it’s not really my preference for enjoying coffee. They have several “modern” coffee options (coffee mixed with various things), along with teas and some food.
I ordered Kalamansi Iced Tea and Vietnamese Drip, but they didn’t quite meet my expectations. They served the Vietnamese coffee without the drip tools, and they forgot to give me a spoon to stir it—maybe they rarely serve that one. The cashier didn’t seem to know much about coffee, but fortunately, the waiter was friendly.
There are toilets and a musholla available here.
I think this place is more suitable for Gen Zs.",okay place hang really preference enjoying coffee several modern coffee options coffee mixed various things along teas food ordered kalamansi iced tea vietnamese drip quite meet expectations served vietnamese coffee without drip tools forgot give spoon stir maybe rarely serve one cashier seem know much coffee fortunately waiter friendly toilets musholla available think place suitable gen

"I visited your place today with my brother. While he was ordering coffee, I sat on a bench with decorative lights. Out of nowhere, an exposed, cut-open wire from those lights shocked me.
The jolt hurt that I felt pain right away, and my right leg cramped and went numb. What really surprised me, though, was how the staff handled it. When I told them what happened, all they said was, “Maaf ya, Kak,” without even asking if I was okay or showing much concern. Then they just taped a tissue napkin over the wire. That felt careless and unsafe, especially since the same thing could easily happen to another guest, even a child or an elderly person.
Please take a serious look at this issue. A little more care for your customers could prevent a much worse accident in the future. Sometimes a simple, “Are you okay?” or “How are you feeling?” can make all the difference. Just a little empathy goes a long way.",visited place today brother ordering coffee sat bench decorative lights nowhere exposed cut open wire lights shocked jolt hurt felt pain right away right leg cramped went numb really surprised though staff handled told happened said maaf kak without even asking okay showing much concern taped tissue napkin wire felt careless unsafe especially since thing could easily happen another guest even child elderly person please take serious look issue little care customers could prevent much worse accident future sometimes simple okay feeling make difference little empathy goes long way
